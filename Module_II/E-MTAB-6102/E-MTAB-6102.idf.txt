Investigation Title	Genome-wide identification of urinary cell-free microRNAs for non-invasive detection of bladder cancer
Experiment Description	Objective was to identify urine cell-free microRNAs enabling early non-invasive detection of bladder cancer. Total RNA enriched for fraction of short RNAs was isolated using Urine microRNA purification kit (Norgen corp.). miRNA profiles were determined using the Affymetrix GeneChip miRNA 3.0 array and analyzed to identify differentially deregulated miRNA in bladder cancer patients compared with helathy controls.

Protocol Description	Collection of 10 mL of first morning voided urine in tube containing 0,186 g EDTA for NA preservation. Centrifugation at 2000 RPM/15'/4 °C. Collection of urine supernatant.	Nucleic acid extraction from 1 mL of urine supernatant using Urine microRNA Purification Kit (Norgen biotek, Canada) accordingly to the manufacturers standard protocol.	Labeling was done accordingly FlashTag™ Biotin HSR RNA Labeling Kit protocol by Affymetrix.	Nucleic acid hybridization was done accordingly FlashTag™ Biotin HSR RNA Labeling Kit protocol by Affymetrix.	Scanning was done accordingly FlashTag™ Biotin HSR RNA Labeling Kit protocol by Affymetrix.
